    "# Lab 5: Calculating the Heritability of Complex Traits with GCTA\n",
    "\n",
    "[Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Overview) (GCTA) was originally designed to estimate the heritability of complex traits using genome-wide SNPs, but has now been extended for numerous other functionalities to better understand the genetic architecture of these traits ([Yang et al., 2011](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(10)00598-7)). Generally, GCTA estimates heritability using the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the a genetic relationship matrix (GRM), which is calculated using the genome-wide SNP data. In today's lab we will become familiar with the GCTA software and some of its capabilities, as well as explore some of the conceptual issues dealt with in class with a large SNP dataset provided by Brandon Pierce. By the end of the lab you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup an interactive job on an RCC compute node**  \n",
    "- **Construct GRMs given BED, FAM, and BIM files**  \n",
    "- **Run standard analysis in GCTA on large datasets (univariate REML)**  \n",
    "- **Run bivariate REML analysis in GCTA**\n",
    "- **Relate how increasing density of markers affects heritability estimate**\n",
    "- **Relate how subsetting markers may affect heritability estimate**\n",

    "Running GCTA is nice because it prints lots of useful information to the screen as it runs, and when it concludes. However, due to the computation required for creating a GRM, and the large size of the some of the input and output files, running it can take a bit of time. Depending on what you're doing for this lab, you can expect some processes to take up to 3 minutes, and of course, with bigger files, it would take even more time. The syntax used to run GCTA is similar to other pipelines we have used on the command line: GCTA is called and modified with option flags (see Section 2.1). For example, one of the first things you will usually need to do is take your SNP data (BED, FAM, BIM formats-just like in PLINK!) and make a GRM. **Try this with the following command and the \"test\" files:**"
