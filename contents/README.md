# Credits to tutorials
The materials in this tutorial collection are distributed under licenses that permit the contents to be freely shared. We have either obtained consent from the owners of the materials to distribute them or redistributed them under the same license as the original source material.

For details, please check the LICENSE file under each folder for the copyright information. Many tutorials, particularly those obtained from https://statgen.us, are initially available in PDF, DOC, and DOCX formats and are continuously updated at: https://github.com/statgenetics/statgen-courses/tree/master/handout. In such cases, the LICENSE file lists the corresponding file names on the first line, and you can find those files using [the provided link](https://github.com/statgenetics/statgen-courses/tree/master/handout).

Many tutorials come in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which can be opened directly in a web browser, allowing you to start running them immediately. However, you need to obtain the data separately and sync them to the same folder structure as the tutorials. The data is hosted on: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18700992/files/
